# URL-Based Question Answering using Pinecone and OpenAI

This application allows users to input a URL and retrieve relevant textual content from that page using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`. The extracted content is chunked, vectorized, and stored in a Pinecone index. Users can query the content with questions, and relevant context is retrieved from Pinecone and passed to OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo to generate answers. The app is built using `Streamlit` for an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **URL Text Extraction**: Extracts the textual content from a webpage using Selenium.
- **Content Chunking**: Splits large blocks of text into overlapping chunks to ensure complete context.
- **Embedding and Vector Storage**: Utilizes OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model to convert text into vectors, which are stored in Pinecone.
- **Pinecone Integration**: Connects to a Pinecone index for vector-based similarity search.
- **Question Answering**: Retrieves relevant chunks from Pinecone based on user queries and constructs a response using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Conversation Memory**: Implements a conversation chain using LangChainâ€™s memory feature for contextual responses.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: Provides the user interface.
- **Selenium**: Automates the webpage interaction to retrieve dynamic content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Parses the webpage content for text extraction.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides embedding for text chunks and generates responses using GPT-3.5.
- **Pinecone**: Stores and retrieves vector embeddings for efficient similarity search.
- **LangChain**: Manages conversation and memory for contextual responses.
